# sudoku-csp
This repository contains the source code of the 3rd assignment of the **"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"** course held at NTNU during the Fall 2023 semester.

It consists in implementing a general solver for **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**, using _backtracking search_ and the arc-consistency algorithm _AC-3_. In our case in particular, it is used to solve different Sudoku boards of increasing difficulty (`easy`, `medium`, `hard` and `very hard`).

The detailed report can be found [here](https://github.com/FrancescaGrimaldi/intro-to-ai-assignments/blob/main/assignment%203/assignment_3.pdf).
